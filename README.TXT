DESCRIPTION: This project was based on developing a GUI for exploring properties that are available for temporary rental in London. 
 This project requires us to create a simple interactive application that works with real-time data 
 set of the London property market from AirBnB. This database has been stored in a CSV file that we 
 essentially load the data from in our java code. This application has been built as a multi-window
 app in which, a user chooses a price range to look for properties all across London. The search is 
 conducted by dividing London into its boroughs and going through the properties in each one. 
 The user may also log in, signup or continue as a guest to go through property viewer. Finally, in 
 another window, the user can access the statistics related to the available properties computed from
 the given database. To implement the layout of this project, we have made use of the scene builder. 
 This Property Viewer consists of a number of features mentioned below.
